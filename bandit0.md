This is the first challenge in the bandit series.
The password to get started is simply bandit0

Once inside, the challenge is to find a file called readme and read the contents of it.

The first step is to verify that it is in your current directory. To do this use ls:
```bash
$ ls
```

After verifying the file is within the current directory, the next step is to read it.

There are two way of doing this
The simplest being, print it to the terminal with

```bash
$ cat readme
```

But my preferred way is using vim
```bash
$ vim readme
```

After that, the password to the next level should be present.

On to level 1!
