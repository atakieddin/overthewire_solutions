This is a repository outlining all of my solutions to the overthewire games

These solutions are not guaranteed to be my own work. I do research when I am stuck and often times come to find the answers.
What is guaranteed to be my own effort is the explanations tied to each command. I fully believe in being able to explain how a solution works.

This is more or less a blog of sorts if I ever come back and need some reference material.

Enjoy!
