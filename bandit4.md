This is the fifth level in the bandit series.

This is a more difficult one. The challenge of this one is to find the only human-readable text in the all of the files.

The way I solved this one was by first finding all the file types with the following command:
```bash
$ file ./-file**
```

With that I was able to see that one file was text, so I opened that one with vim and found the password.

On to level 5!
