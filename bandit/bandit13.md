This is the fourteenth challenge in the bandit series.

This one is less of a challenge and more just a demostration.

There is a private ssh key in the main directory that is used to ssh into the next level.
(Also take note that bandit14 is at the localhost)

To specify a private ssh key, use the -i tag as below:
```bash
$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
```
Accept the dialog and continue on.

On to level 14! (Which we kind of are already on...)
