This is the eigth challenge of bandit series.

The challenge in this one is to find the password next to the word "millionth"

This one is pretty trivial, using vim to just search for the word is one way or with
```bash
$ cat data.txt | grep "millionth"
```

The line that appears will contain the password to the next level.

On to level 8!
