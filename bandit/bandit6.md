This is the seventh level in the bandit series.

This level is pretty easy as well, simply go to the root directory:
```bash
$ cd /
```

And go to the /etc/ directory
```bash
$ cd /etc/
```

go to the folder labled bandit\_pass and view the bandit6 file and the password should be there.

On to level 7!
